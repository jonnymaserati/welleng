# Benchmark log

Append-only record of benchmark runs, newest first. This log is the **evidence for
the pre-merge benchmark gate**: performance-sensitive engine code must be benchmarked
+ profiled and logged here BEFORE it is merged (see
[`docs/dev/BENCHMARK_GATE.md`](../docs/dev/BENCHMARK_GATE.md)). Timings are per-host
and indicative — compare RELATIVE change on the same machine, not absolute numbers.

Each entry: date · branch/commit · host · the numbers · what changed + the profile
finding that motivated it.

`python benchmarks/bench_kick_tolerance.py`

| operation | before | after | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drill_kick` (H-Y auto Z) | 45.3 µs | **22.6 µs** | 2.0× |
| `migrate` (n_steps=100) | 573 ms | **293 ms** | 2.0× |
| `max_influx_circulated` (inverse solve) | 7491 ms | **3758 ms** | 2.0× |

**Profile finding (cProfile on `max_influx_circulated`):** ~95 % of the time was the
Hall-Yarborough Z-factor Newton solve — 12.5 M `reduced_density` calls, 65 M residual
+ 53 M derivative evaluations — invoked scalar-sequentially inside a forward-Euler
gas-column integration.

**Change (pure speed, results unchanged — the 39-test kick validation suite is the
guardrail):**
- inlined `_hy_residual` / `_hy_residual_derivative` into `reduced_density` and
  precomputed the temperature-coefficient groups once per solve (kills ~118 M Python
  function calls + repeated power math);
- warm-started the Newton from the previous nearby sub-step's `y`
  (`hall_yarborough_z_and_y` / `_z_and_y_at`) — ~2 iterations instead of ~5, same
  converged root to 1e-12;
- isothermal temperature callable returns the scalar instead of allocating a fresh
  `np.full` array per call (~11 M allocations removed).

**Not done (blocked):** vectorizing the Newton across sub-steps — the integration is
forward-Euler (each pressure depends on the previous), so the solves are sequential.

Validation: `tests/test_migration.py test_nogepa.py test_spe208788_worked_example.py
test_spe202426_fig12.py test_spe140113_santos.py test_kick_tolerance.py test_gas_z.py`
= 39 passed, 1 skipped (identical results before/after).
